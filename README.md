## Synoposis
This project copies windows spotlight images, of certain -hard coded- dimensions to User's Pictures directory, so the user may save
them for later use as desktop wallpapers.

## Motivation
This should serve as a faster way than navigating inside hidden files, and changing extensions to all images, detecting garbage, and filtering
the ones with the desired dimensions manually.
